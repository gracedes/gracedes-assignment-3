    "## Instructions:\n",
    "In this assignment, you will apply **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** as a preprocessing step to the **MNIST dataset** and train a **logistic regression classifier**. You will compare the model performance and training time when using different levels of SVD for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will need to:\n",
    "1. Load the MNIST dataset and normalize it.\n",
    "2. Perform SVD and reduce the dimensions of the data.\n",
    "3. Train a logistic regression model on the original and SVD-reduced data.\n",
    "4. Measure and compare the training time and accuracy of the model with varying SVD components.\n",
    "5. Plot the results and analyze how SVD impacts the performance and efficiency of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "Your tasks include:\n",
    "1. Implement SVD algorithm. You are not allowed to directly use SVD implemented by other packages, but you may use functions in NumPy. (Part 2)\n",
    "2. Explore the accuracy and time performance from different numbers of SVD components. (Part 4)\n",
    "3. Visualize the accuracy, time performance and top 5 singular vectors in the dataset, analyze and explain which number of SVD component looks best to you? (Part 4,5&6) Hint: singular vectors should be reshaped to 28x28 images for visualization.\n",
    "***\n",
    "**Note that you may not import any other function or package.** Let's get started!\n"
